!!! warning "Note"

    This page covers FE energy transfer options. For EU energy, check the [GregTech Energy](/trulyno/StarT-docs/Gameplay/Mechanics/GregTech/Energy) page.

### Laser IO

**Laser IO** is a highly recommended option for wireless FE energy transmit, available <lv>pre-LV</lv>. Each **Laser Node** connection can transmit up to 1 million FE/tick, more than enough to last you until mid game and **Flux Networks**.

### Create Wires

**Create Wires** are an incredibly cheap option for energy transmission, but have very low transfer speed. **Create Wires** come in different tiers, with transfer speed ranging from 1024 FE/tick for **Copper Wires** to 8096 FE/tick for **Overcharged Diamond Wires**. While viable in <lv>LV</lv> and <mv>MV</mv>, it is recommended to switch to **Laser IO** as soon as possible.

### Pipez

Pipez **Energy Pipes** are technically available as an option, but are strongly recommended against due to their underwhelming transfer rates without upgrades, with **Create Wires** offering better speeds at a lower cost. The initial transfer rate is 256 FE/tick, but can thankfully be upgraded up to 131072 FE/tick, although the max tier upgrades are only available at <ev>EV</ev>.

### P2P Energy

Applied Energistics 2's **Energy P2P Tunnels** are a space-efficient option offering virtually limitless energy transfer rates available <mv>late-MV</mv> to <hv>early-HV</hv>. **P2P Tunnels** come at a cost, however: transferring energy between **P2P Tunnels** incurs a ***5% energy loss***, so **Flux Networks** are generally preferred to **P2P Energy** after they are unlocked in <ev>EV</ev>.

### Flux Networks

**Flux Networks** are an incredibly powerful wireless energy transfer (and storage) solution available in <ev>EV</ev> and gated by PTFE. **Flux Nodes** have exorbitant transfer rates(1) similar to **P2P Tunnels**, but don't have any additional energy draw, and are thus recommended as the main FE energy transfer option starting from <ev>EV</ev> until the very endgame.
