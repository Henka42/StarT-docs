### Modular Routers

While considered a fairly niche option, **Modular Routers** can be used to transfer items wirelessly with **Puller/Sender Modules**. **Mk2 Puller Modules** pull items up to 12 blocks away (or 24 blocks with 12 **Range Augments**), while **Mk2 Sender Modules** send items up to 24 blocks away (or 48 blocks with 24 **Range Augments**).

 Getting **Blaze Powder** in <hv>HV</hv> unlocks **Mk3 Sender Modules** that can send items across an unlimited range, and **Speed Upgrades** that can be used to increase item transfer speed even further up to 640 items/second.
