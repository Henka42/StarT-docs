# Fluids

### Fluid Cells

Thermal's **Fluid Cells** are one of the earliest options available for automatic fluid transfer, and are a great option for close-range fluid transport. **Fluid Cells** have a big initial buffer of 32 buckets, and can be configured to automatically input and output fluids through the menu at a sizable max transfer rate of *8 buckets/tick*. Thermal upgrades can be used on **Fluid Cells**, increasing the buffer to 8192 buckets and transfer rate to an astounding **2048 buckets/tick**, making them extremely powerful for close-range fluid transport. 

### Laser IO

**Laser IO** offers easy wireless fluid transfer, available <lv>pre-LV</lv> and gated by gold. **Laser Nodes** can be set to transmit fluids through a **Fluid Card**, with an initial speed of 5 buckets/second that can be upgraded with 4 **Logistic Overclockers** to transmit 40 buckets/4 ticks, or *10 buckets/tick*. **Laser IO** is generally recommended for mid-long range fluid transfer until other options like **Applied Energistics 2 Networks** are available.

### Create Pipes

Create's **Mechanical Pumps** and **Fluid Pipes** are by far the cheapest fluid transfer option available early game, only requiring **Copper Plates** and spare amounts of **Andesite Alloy**. However, they require rotational force to operate, and don't have a particularly high transfer rate compared to other options. A **Mechanical Pump's** transfer rate depends on the RPM according to the formula *`0.5mB/tick * RPM`*, up to a maximum of *128mB/tick*(1) for 256 RPM.

1. 2.56 buckets / second.

### Pipez

Pipez **Fluid Pipes** and **Ultimate Pipes** allow for easy close-mid range fluid transfer, and **Ultimate Pipes** can be used to make compact item/fluid transport setups, though their initial transfer rate is somewhat slow. The base transfer rate for both pipe types is 50mB/tick(1) and can be upgraded up to 10 buckets/tick in <ev>EV</ev>.

### GregTech Machine Covers

Besides just being a crafting material, GregTech's **Electric Pumps** (as well as **Fluid Regulators**) can be installed on the sides of GregTech machines as ***machine covers***, allowing them to push/pull fluids from nearby inventories without taking up space. **Fluid Regulators** offer additional configuration options compared to **Electric Pumps**, but are otherwise similar. <lv>**LV Pumps**</lv> and <lv>**LV Fluid Regulators**</lv> transfer 64mB/tick(1) with the higher tiers providing increasingly higher transfer rates up to a maximum of 1048 buckets/tick at <uv>UV</uv>.

### Applied Energistics 2

Besides item logistics, **Applied Energistics 2 ME Networks** can also similarly be used for exceptionally powerful multi-fluid transport and storage. **ME Networks** are available starting from <mv>late-MV</mv> to <hv>early-HV</hv>, and are highly recommended to set up as soon as possible.
